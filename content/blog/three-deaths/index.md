This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future. But for today, alittle piece of wisdom about death, not sjust one but three.

Here is a quote from  **David Eagleman** [salted duck eggs](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/336070-there-are-three-deaths-the-first-is-when-the-body).

>"There are three deaths. The first is when the body ceases to function.
>The second is when the body is consigned to the grave. 
>The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your name is spoken for the last time.”—
>Chapter 8 in Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives.
