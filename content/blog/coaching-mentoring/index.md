description: Understading the essense of good coaching and mentoring based on the book from Michael Stanier "The Coaching Habit"
---

I have recently watched a video at the beginning of the week about **THE COACHING HABIT** by Michael Bungay Stanier. Stainer advocates that the best mentors and trainer are those that "listen more" and "talk less". That one's advise is not as good as we think it is.

He advises to engage people through a few key questions:
  - What's on your mind?
  - What else? Any other challenges?
  - What is the real challenge for you?
  - What give you the most relief?
  - If you say yes to one thing what would you say no to?

Devised a template to collect data on mentoring sessions based on these set of questions. This is meant to engage people on the issues that matter most, and what they need to do as well as not do to focus on what matters. 

Business coach Mickael Porter said: 
>"The essense of strategy is knowing what not to do"

As part of the template, I have added a happy/sad/ok feeling meter at the end of the session to gauge what their feeling was since the last chat.
Final quote by Stanier: 
>"The change of behavior at the heart of what this book is about is this: a little more asking people questions
>and a little less telling people what to do."

The skill is to listen more and speak less. Need to remember that :)
