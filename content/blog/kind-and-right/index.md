description: With the power of rightousness comes the responsability of kindness.

I have recently read an [!article](https://medium.com/s/story/its-not-enough-to-be-right-you-also-have-to-be-kind-b8814111fe1) about the need for empathy and persuasion in our modern concourse by **Ryan Holiday** author of one of my favourite books *Ego is the Enemy*.
The author postulates that when intereacting with each other it is not enough to be right, but we also have to be kind. He drew parallels with *Jeff Bezos* story from when he was young boy. Jeff aged nine hearing about how many minutes each cigarette takes from a persons life on the local radio, quickly did the math and went straight to his grandmother who was a chain smoker and said: "Grandma! you lost 9 years of you life.". His grandmother got very upset and started crying. Jeff's grandfather being a chain smoker himself pulled his grandson to the side and told him: " Jeff, one day you'll understand that is a lot harder to be kind than it is to be clever." Wise words indeed.

Upon hearing this, I couldn't help to draw the same parallels with my daily interactions with children. As a parent I often repremind my children about not being kind to each other in particular in the language they use which can be harsh and abrupt. The children often reply that they were in fact "Right!" in their comments, that "such and such was stupid!" :)Such reasoning is correct but it 'captures the conceit of a dangerous assumption we seem to have made as a culture these days' that being right grants us the license to be a total jerk. While this is perhaps true for many adults, I don't think that is necessarly true for children. They bear often no malice in thair comment, some are made in anger yes, but other are innocent interpretation of fact. 

> You are right but don't need to be mean.

Children might lack empathy but it is an importan lessons we teach them and yet this seems to have been lost for many of us adults out there. There is little space for empathy when only have a 140 characters to express yourself.

> The desire for viral sharing heightens the need for aggressive, simplistic arguments. Ryan Holiday

The dominant goal of our concourse 

> The goal is no longer *persuasion* but *signaling*.  

### It's the language of simplicity we just need more vocabulary
### Intellectuals are being pushed out of the coversation and they should be worried. As the arguement shifts from intellectual debates where we dispute facts and data, to that of yelling, trolling callous callouts that are so prevalent in our culture today.

Ryan Holiday:

We care little about other people and put little effort in persuading.
With signalling it's vehemance that matters not quality.
140 or 240 characters don't leave much space for humility and kindness.
Political correctness has become such a problem, that the only solution is blunt, merciless honesty.
Talking heads know that only good insult or a sick burn will get them online pickups the next day.
The game of "behalfism" where we are offended on behalf of other marginalised groups has become utterly absurd.
charactised but too much superiority and certainty and not nearly enought intellectual humilty or empathy.
It is much easier to be certain and clever than to be nuanced and nice
We have made almost zero success. Because tou cannot reason peopl our of positions they didn't reason themselves into.
Joe Rogan doesn't tell anyone what to think. He just tell peopleto relate to others.

If you can't be kind and can empathise than you are not on the team. TEAM HUMANITY!
