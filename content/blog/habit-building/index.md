## Successful Habits
Successful habits are those that stick. For habits to stick we need to make them:

1. __Obvious__    : a habit needs to have an obvious queue, such as an alarm clock, first thing in the morning, or getting off the train, then you will less likely lose track of it.
2. __Easy__       : a habit needs to be easy. Difficult habit don't generally last long. If you want to read more books, start by trying to read a chapter a day. If that is too hard, cut it down to 5 pages or even 2 a day.
The easier the habit is the more likely it will stick. Sticky habits are good habits :)
1. __Attractive__ : a habit need to be attractive and not the cosmetic sense. 
2. __Satisfying__ : 

James Clear in his book **ATOMIC HABITS** calls these the *4 Laws of Habit*.

## Checklist to Habit Building

### Pick One (and only one)
Pick a habit you'll want a year from now not necessarly one you want now. Make it a productive habit, one for wich you will continuously score victories, no matter how small they are.

>“People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide
their futures.” – F. M. Alexander

### Keep those habits small and achievable

Don't set yourself for failure. Keep those habits tiny. The smaller the habit the more likely it is to stick. Remember the goal! You wan these habit to serve you and pave the path to your success. Little pebbles can pave that road as much as the big rocks. Most importantly, don't rely on motivation. Motivation sucks, it draws energy from the power of your ego, and ego is the enemy.

### Set a time and space for your habit

 “Everyday, at/after [TIME
or EXISTING HABIT], I will go to [LOCATION] and start [INITIAL ACTION].”
“I sit at my typewriter every morning at 8 AM in case something happens." - Flannery
O'Connor
Don’t miss 2 in a row
Failing to execute a daily habit one day, reduces the odds of retaining that habit by 5%. Failing to
execute a habit 2 days in a row, reduces the odds of retaining that habit by 55%! Miss more than 2
days and you can kiss your new habit goodbye. Therefore, never miss doing the minimum daily
requirement for 2 days in a row. If you miss one day, make it a priority for the next day.
“Be boring and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your
work" – Gustave Flaubert
Set the Stakes
According to Stickk.com, people who set goals with money on the line are twice as likely to reach
their goal. To increase your odds of successfully building a habit, tell a friend exactly what you’ll
give up if you fail to do the daily minimum requirement more than two days in a row (money, or an
experience you’re looking forward to). Put it in writing to increase your accountability.
“Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines, practiced every day.” - Jim
Rohn
Don’t Trust it (yet)
Never trust a habit until it feels automatic to initiate. According to research it takes an average of
66 days for a new behavior to become automatic. Until you can execute a habit without thinking
about it and it feels weird not to do it (like not brushing your teeth in the morning), maintain the
tiny minimum daily requirement and avoid focusing on any other habits.
"I fear not the man who has practiced 10 000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has
practiced one kick 10 000 times." - Bruce Lee
When automatic: Promote
When a habit feels automatic we can raise the daily minimum requirement. Reading 1 page a day
turns in 5, then 10, then 20, etc. Increase the requirement each week until you hit your target.
