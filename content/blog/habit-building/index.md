## Successful Habits
Successful habits are those that stick. For habits to stick we need to make them:

1. __Obvious__    : a habit needs to have an obvious queue, such as an alarm clock, first thing in the morning, or getting off the train, then you will likely lose track of it.
2. __Easy__       : a habit needs to be easy.
3. __Attractive__ :
4. __Satisfying__ :

James Clear in his book **ATOMIC HABITS** calls these the *4 Laws of Habit*.
