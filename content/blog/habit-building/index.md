## Successful Habits
Successful habits are those that stick. For habits to stick we need to make them:

1. __Obvious__    : a habit needs to have an obvious queue, such as an alarm clock, first thing in the morning, or getting off the train, then you will less likely lose track of it.
2. __Easy__       : a habit needs to be easy. Difficult habit don't generally last long. If you want to read more books, start by trying to read a chapter a day. If that is too hard, cut it down to 5 pages or even 2 a day.
The easier the habit is the more likely it will stick. Sticky habits are good habits :)
1. __Attractive__ : a habit need to be attractive and not the cosmetic sense. 
2. __Satisfying__ : 

James Clear in his book **ATOMIC HABITS** calls these the *4 Laws of Habit*.

## Checklist to Habit Building

### Pick One (and only one)
Pick a habit you'll want a year from now not necessarly one you want now. Make it a productive habit, one for wich you will continuously score victories, no matter how small they are.

>“People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide
their futures.” – F. M. Alexander

### Keep those habits small and achievable

Don't set yourself for failure. Keep those habits tiny. The smaller the habit the more likely it is to stick. Remember the goal! You wan these habit to serve you and pave the path to your success. Little pebbles can pave that road as much as the big rocks. Most importantly, don't rely on motivation. Motivation sucks, it draws energy from the power of your ego, and ego is the enemy.

### Set a time and space for your habit

Just like planning a meeting so should you plan your habit. If you have ever been in a meeting than you already know it is very much like a **contract**. You agree to meet a person at a *certain time* at a chosen *location* to discuss or perform a certain *task*.  
Set a contract for your habit with a pattern that is simple and persistable.

```
Everyday, at/after [TIME or EXISTING HABIT], I will go to [LOCATION] and start [INITIAL ACTION]
```

### Don't miss 2 in a row

Failing to execute a daily habit one day, reduces the odds of retaining that habit by 5%. Failing to
execute a habit 2 days in a row, reduces the odds of retaining that habit by 55%! Miss more than 2
days and you can kiss your new habit goodbye.

work" – Gustave Flaubert

### Set the Stakes
According to Stickk.com, people who set goals with money on the line are twice as likely to reach
their goal. To increase your odds of successfully building a habit, tell a friend exactly what you’ll
give up if you fail to do the daily minimum requirement more than two days in a row (money, or an
experience you’re looking forward to). Put it in writing to increase your accountability.

Rohn

### Don't fall for the early successes

A habit is not a habit until it becomes seemless and automaically triggered. It takes time for a habit to persist into a thoughtless pattern. Studies showed showed that it takes on average 2 months to a habit to set in.

practiced one kick 10 000 times." - Bruce Lee

### When automatic: increase the tempo

When you no longeer think of a habit. It is time to promote it, shift up a gear and increase the amount you have already set. If you are doing 10 press ups a day, increase it my 4% the next day and the day after until such time that the habit feels difficult. Step down a couple of gears and maintain until it feels easy and satisfying.
