## Notes
```
Cognitive resonance is the term Featinger coined to describe the inner tension we feel when our beliefs are challenged by evidence.

A person will always try to reduce dissonance by altering one of his beliefs/ideas and avoid situations and information which will increase it.

According to the action-based model of cognitive dissonance, individuals are motivated to reduce dissonance because it can interfere with effective action.

We are at this point simply desperate to reinterpret the failure as a success in disguise, giving us the assurance that we were right all along, that we are not dupes, but smart and rational individuals.

So we reframe the evidence. We join our closet rational supportive emotion : denial!!

Our ego pushes us to think that there must be truth is our reasoning otherwise we would not have reached that conclusion. Ego is our enemy it prevents us from coming to acceptance with the fact that we are not as smart as we would like to think. To acknowledge that we can sometimes be wrong even when the stakes are high.

We like to think of ourselves as smart and rational being with sound reasoning, we don’t like to think of ourselves as dupes. Our self esteem is threatened, our ego is aroused.

When we are confronted with evidence that challenges our deeply held beliefs we are more like to reframe the evidence than we are to alter our beliefs.

Humility is antithesis of ego. Its importance is emphasized throughout the scriptures. 

> God does not like the arrogant showoffs "Walk humbly and lower your voice - the ugliest voice is the donkey’s voice." [Quran 31:18-19]

ego can become an idol and the consequences can be detrimental for our 

kill the ego

>[Quran 13:11] ...God does not change the condition of any people unless they themselves make the decision to change...

>[Quran 47:14] Are those enlightened by their Lord the same as those whose evil works are adorned in their eyes, and they follow their own opinions?

Thoughtful Opinions Held Loosely
How do you respond when you’re faced with facts that contradict a sometimes long-held and cherished belief?

Do you update your knowledge database with the new facts, or do you flail about and try to rationalize or refute the new facts so as not to upset the status quo?

As much as we’d love to consider ourselves open-minded and ever eager to learn, our human nature is to disregard information that could cause us any cognitive dissonance. It requires substantial effort to be firm enough in our convictions that we can be bold in our actions, yet humble enough to leave room to be wrong.

None of us have a perfect understanding of the world we live in.  As our understanding increases, we must be willing to adapt and change if we are to learn and grow to position ourselves to lead the life we want to live.

When we resist that growth, or feel threatened by new information, we intentionally or unintentionally filter out evidence that may clash with our current opinions, thus keeping us safe in our ignorance. We sacrifice being correct for being “right.”

That, for personal and professional development, is the kiss of death.

Cognitive resonance however is only harmful when it stops us from learning and improving our reasonning, so it is more scientific and brutal in it's self assessment. But denial can also be beneficial when it's an act of self preservation, when reason is sacrificed for the sake of mental sanity and decisiveness in action.

I came to the strong believe that those times of self reflection are very precious. Whether in religious prayer or in pursuit of adventure up a mountain, or to enjoy one's solitude, in the quest to challenge our reasoning of the world and ourselves. 

Much like taking the car for the yearly MOT, we need to regularly keep our ego at check, to reserve the time for honest self appraisal where we connect with our inner voice and ensure we do not fall victim on one's treachereus narcissism.

When coming to a new position we tend to believe Strongly in the probity of the system we have just joined. One where strong moral principles; honesty and decency are key and integral the system. That often fades with time as we see mediocre performance go unnoticed or unpunished. This is a viewed as dishonesty and we start slowly loosing faith in the system and trust capita diminishes.

elf-justification is insidious. There is nothing worse that to lie to oneself, it destroys any path to learning as we do not or cannot recognise our failures. We dig deep into the arsenal of dissonance reduction like narrative manipulation to convince ourselves that we did nothing wrong, there was no failure.

Confirmation bias. When we look at the evidence in a light that always confirm our initial beliefs and conclusions and not by being self critical of it by challenging those very beliefs and conclusion. This is particularly symptomatic of those senior and very intelligent people, where the subconscious urge to to bridge that gap between believe and evidence leads to spinning the narrative rather than Learning from it. This reframing exercise is largely subconscious but is the most formidable. Barrier to progress in the world.
